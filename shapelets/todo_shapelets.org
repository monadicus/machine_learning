#+STARTUP: logdone


* TODO Write a paper on shapelets for structured data.
** TODO Write in the document but export to latex 
* TODO Write some examples uses.
Ideas:
1. Time series of graphs.
2. Time series of trees
3. Time series of structured data (terms).
Could be used in Reactome Pengine.
People send queries and programs. These are terms.
We also have the proof tree for the queries.

* We would be classifiying users. 
Perhaps by qualification or instiution or field.

* We could also cluster users.

* TODO Get the demo code working.
** DONE Find info gain formular and check understanding

* Introduction

Shapelets were first proposed in *. They have been used in X, Y.
Our work was inspired by the potenital uses in Pengine technology.
In pengine technoloy users send programs and queries to be run on prolog servers.
Therefore the providers of these services collect structured data.
This structured data is a series of queries and programs.


Providers of these services would like to be able to classify there users.
For example willing to pay or not willing to pay
It will also be useful to find clusters of users, in order to find commonalities of differnt types of users.

* Machine learning structured data

There are many algorithms for learning with structured data, for example ILP type  algorithms such as Progol, Tilde, and Foil.

There is also propositionaltion techniques.

There is also distance techniques.

There is also kernel techniques.

Shapelets work with data that is structued across time, but not any other relation.
If each time point has structure, for example a graphs, programs and sets then.
The




* Distancs and kernels for structured data

Distance functions RIBL 
Kfoil
Nfoil
Skolemnisation

* Experments
We use the train based dataset

An instance is a sequence of trains.
A positive instance is a sequence of trains blah

We compare this method to using Aleph for run time and accuracy.
We also compare to treeliker.
And ribl.



* Results
Shaplet classifier are faster and more acurate !ha
